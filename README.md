# Autonomous-Snake-Algorithm-for-Eye-Images

Given a set of Eye images taken during a specific surgery, the requirement is to isolate the eye-lids and retina areas so that analysis of blood vessels could be done easily. Design an autonomous Snake algorithm to enable this segmentation for a number of images. Image credits: Dr. Uvais Qidwai.
